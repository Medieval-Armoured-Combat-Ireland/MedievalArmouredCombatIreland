Medieval Armoured Combat Ireland is a group of people who are  
interested in the study and practice of the martial arts of the  
medieval knight. We train in the use of the sword, longsword, polearm,  
group fighting, and other weapons of the medieval knight.  
We train in a safe and controlled manner, and we train for both  
competition and for fun. **This is a full contact sport.**
